## Fonts
When picking fonts for this project, I wanted something that feels 'viking-esque' without making it cartoonish. 
The fonts I ended up chosing are; 
Lora for H1 headings
Tangerine for H2
Palanquin for list items and paragraphs

These were all picked out from generating font via https://fontjoy.com/
The fonts were then imported from https://fonts.google.com

# Bugs

Score not resetting when pressing the reset button, but only when a new game is started and the next move is made.

## Fixed bugs

The computer choice didn't pick images according to console.log, and made me worried that something was wrong with the array.
Solved: Got adviced by a Slack member that the console.log was placed above the initialized function, and the computer was picking out the correct option.


## Deployment

This project was deployed via GitHub Pages and the Gitpod browser, used as a development environment. From here I could commit and push my changes throughout the project.

Steps I took to deploy my website;

- Go to the repository for  Portfolio-project-1
- Click the Settings tab and locate the Pages tab
- Select to deploy from main branch
- A few minutes later, upon refreshing the page, my site was live
